# Aspect-Five

Hi my names Alex, here's where I keep my code. Some of these are mini projects others will be problems (usually math based) that i've solved whilst practicing.

The CA# files are problems that can be found on codeabbey.com I found them useful in wrapping my head around some of the basics.
They are made to solve the problem, and on the site they give you a relatively large input data set to input at once, while i don't have access to those whilst uploading these,
I have included example data sets with each problem. The comments within specify the problem.

TicTacToe allows two people to play noughts and crosses with each other in the console window.

Blackjack lets a player play against the dealer. Bettign included.

War runs on autopilot as two "players" play war with a deck of cards, the rules don't allow for much freedom so even with live participants the game more or less runs on autopilot.

The unit converter allows users to convert different units within different categories. eg kilograms into tonnes, knots into mph, pounds into yen, etc.

More to come,

Enjoy
