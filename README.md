# Aspect-Five

Hi my names Alex, here's where I keep my code. Some of these are mini projects others will be problems (usually math based) that i've solved whilst practicing.

The CA# files are problems that can be found on codeabbey.com I found them useful in wrapping my head around some of the basics.
They are made to solve the problem, and on the site they give you a relatively large input data set to input at once, while i don't have access to those whilst uploading these,
I have included example data sets with each problem. The comments within specify the problem.

Enjoy
